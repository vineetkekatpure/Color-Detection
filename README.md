# Color-Detection-
In this python mini-project, we use open cv and machine learning to select images from the computer and know the color name of the selected pixel of the image.

To run the code, open a terminal/command prompt and type "python color_detection.py -i pic.jpg"
the "pic.jpg" can be replaced by the filename of the picture you want to use
